ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to music tech, AI-driven recommendations, or clean, scalable front-end design systems.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with scaling real-time systems, handling audio data pipelines, and deploying lightweight backends for live projects.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about C++, JavaScript, building with React, or how to go from an idea to a working prototype quickly.
