## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

#<!--
**Suyash-coder-12/Suyash-coder-12** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on BeatsVibe

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, focusing on performance optimization and competitive coding patterns.

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to music tech, AI-driven recommendations, or clean, scalable front-end design systems.

ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with scaling real-time systems, handling audio data pipelines, and deploying lightweight backends for live projects.

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about C++, JavaScript, building with React, or how to go from an idea to a working prototype quickly.

ğŸ“« How to reach me: [rathodsuyash52@gmail.com]

âš¡ Fun fact: I can listen to lo-fi beats for 8 hours straight and still write clean, bug-free code... most of the time ğŸ˜„
