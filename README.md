## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on BeatsVibe

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, focusing on performance optimization and competitive coding patterns.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to music tech, AI-driven recommendations, or clean, scalable front-end design systems.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with scaling real-time systems, handling audio data pipelines, and deploying lightweight backends for live projects.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about C++, JavaScript, building with React, or how to go from an idea to a working prototype quickly.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: [rathodsuyash52@gmail.com]

âš¡ Fun fact: I can listen to full vibe beats for 8 hours straight and still write clean, bug-free code... most of the time ðŸ˜„
